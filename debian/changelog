  * add debian/patches/130_fix_oss_ctrl_space_accelerator.patch:
    - don't include level4nl but only level4n for french oss layout.
      both space and Ctrl + space returned the same XLookupString, which
      prevents space using in some application using
      gtk_action_group_add_toggle_actions to setup Ctrl + space accelerator.
      We lose rctrl accelator but that's better than not having space in
      those applications. Setup it manually will reintroduce
